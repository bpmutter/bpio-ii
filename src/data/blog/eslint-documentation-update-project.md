Over the past couple of months I've been working on updating the technical documentation for [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/), the JavaScript linter.

It's been a very interesting and educational experience contributing to this super popular project (over 10 milli downloads/week on npm!).

You can see all the work in the project in this Github issue: https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16365

I'm still very much in the middle of the project. Right now I don't really have the time or desire to write up a whole blog post reflecting upon my work on the project, but maybe I will one day!
