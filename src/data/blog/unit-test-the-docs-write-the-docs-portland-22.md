description: "Conference talk about adding unit-tested code examples to documentation. Presented at Write The Docs Portland 2022. "
---
Technical writers face the constant challenge of keeping code examples accurate and up-to-date. Just as software developers write unit tests to validate that their code remains functional, technical writers can create code examples within unit tests to validate that their documentation is correct.

This talk covers:

- Why you should write code examples within unit tests
- What you should test
- How to implement tested code examples using [Bluehawk](https://mongodb-university.github.io/Bluehawk/)
- How to set up continuous integration tests to make sure that code examples always work
