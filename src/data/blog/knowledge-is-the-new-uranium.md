At the AI Engineers World's Fair conference in San Francisco in June 2024, I presented the talk "Knowledge Is the New Uranium." 

Here's the abstract for the talk:

> It's long been said that "data is the new oil". With the recent rise of generative AI technologies, we have a new event more precious digital resource fueling the digital economy: knowledge. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has presented the first generative AI use case for organizations to use their knowledge resources, like documentation, knowledge bases, and code repositories. This talk explores various other ways that organizations can use the knowledge resources they ingest for RAG to fuel growth and productivity. Use cases for knowledge resources covered in this presentation include traditional natural language processing, fine-tuning models, and creating knowledge APIs for AI agents to consume. Attendees will come away from this talk with actionable guidance on how they can leverage their knowledge resources for maximum efficacy.

- I also have a blog post post on the subject that's been stuck 3/4-written for a few months. I'll finish it and publish it when the weather is less nice outside.
