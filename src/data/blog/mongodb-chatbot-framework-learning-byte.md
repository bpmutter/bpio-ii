This video is a 20-minute overview of the MongoDB Chatbot Framework and how to build an app with it. The video was made as part of MongoDB University Learning Bytes.

From the video's description:

> In this Learning Byte, a MongoDB expert will guide you through using the MongoDB Chatbot Framework to create your own AI chatbot. Youâ€™ll uncover the foundational differences between large language models and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in modern chatbots and dive into how MongoDB's Framework leverages Atlas Vector Search to deliver precise, context-aware responses.
>
> We'll end with a hands-on demo of creating a cookbook chatbot about the Boston Cooking School Cookbook, and provide insights into customizing your own chatbot applications.
