For the past couple of months, I've been working on the MongoDB Chatbot Framework. We took the lessons learned from creating the MongoDB AI chatbot, and created a framework out of it for others to build their own chatbots. To learn more about framework, read the launch blog post [Build a Production-Ready, Intelligent Chatbot With the MongoDB Chatbot Framework](https://dev.to/mongodb/build-a-production-ready-intelligent-chatbot-with-the-mongodb-chatbot-framework-4dd).
