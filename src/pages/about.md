I work at the intersection of software development and technical communication.

Currently, I'm working as a Senior Software Engineer at MongoDB. I build generative AI products that teach developers about MongoDB and accelerate our internal content creation workflow.

Previously, I worked on documenting the Realm mobile database, Atlas App Services, and led the creation of documentation for the Kotlin Driver.

Before this position, I was the first Technical Writer at TrueAccord, a fintech company. At TrueAccord, I created technical product documentation, established organizational best practices for technical writing, created compliance documentation, and more. I also served as Market Development Lead at Mavatar Technologies, a small Silicon Valley e-commerce startup. As Market Development Lead, I worked in close collaboration with Mavatar’s executive team on sales, marketing and content campaigns.

I also founded PerlWrite, a content creation organization, where I collaborated with startups to realize their content strategy in the form of website copy, eBooks, blog posts, email campaigns and more.

Prior to working in tech, I taught English in Seoul, South Korea and Cuenca, Ecuador.

## AFK 

When I’m not hunched in front of my computer coding or writing (though that is most of my life these days), I like to read, practice yoga (which I actually started to compensate for the back pain that all the keyboard hunching was causing, and have grown to quite like it, but I digress…), hang out with my friends, and get off the beaten path.

I’m also a passionate traveler and devoted believer in remote work. I have just returned to my native New York, but have spent the previous 4+ years living and working abroad.
